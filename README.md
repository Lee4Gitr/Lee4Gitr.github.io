# Neighborhood-Map
Udacity Project to design a neighborhood map using Google API, a third party API, and Knockout.js. I looked through many people's code for inspiration and help.
I used MarkN's implementation of OAuth in javascript, GauthamRajesh function loop on the Yelp API and infowindow formatting, and I used code from gokuldh. Other 
people's code that I looke through but did not conciously copy were dishanique, mtoback, and sheryllun. I also used material from Udacity's google maps course.
## How to 
1. Open index.html in your preferred browser.
2. Click on links in list or markers on the map.
3. Look at some of the cool local areas in Seminole Heights in Tampa!
